# [Python Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp)

- strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing `unicode` characters.
``` python
a = "Hello, 潘卡羅"
print(a[7])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Strings are Arrays ==> acces the elemet of arrays
- Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

``` python
a = "Hello, 潘卡羅!"
print(a[4])

# strings == > array
# index begins with 0
```
- Looping Through a String

``` python
for x in "潘卡羅":
  print(x)
```
- String Length:To get the length of a string, use the `len()`function.
``` python
a = "Hello, 潘卡羅!"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
```

QUIZ:tell me how many char appear in "learning python"

``` python
a = "learning python"
print(len(a))
# wrong: print(length(a))
# 15 = 14 letter 1 space
```
- Check String:To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword `in`.
- keyword `in` vs `if`
- True or False
``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
# print("free" in txt) == > True
# print("HDJSAdhj" in txt) == > True
print("HJSAdh" in txt)  # False
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HDJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HDJSAdhj' is present.")
```

``` python
txt = "The best things in life are free!HDJSAdhjs  dhsjahd32 dsaDJHSajdh "
if "HJSAdhj" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'HJSAdhj' is present.")
```
- Negative Indexing
``` python
b = "Hello, 潘卡羅!"
print(b[-5:-2])
# -2 not included
```
- Python - Modify Strings
- The `upper()` method returns the string in upper case:
- The lower() method returns the string in lower case
``` python
b = "Hello, 潘卡羅!"
print(b.upper())
```
- Remove Whitespace with `strip()` method
- The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end
``` python
b = " Hello, 潘卡羅! "
print(b.strip())
```
- The `replace()`method replaces a string with another string
``` python
b = " Hello, 潘卡羅! "
print(b.replace("o", "w"))
```
